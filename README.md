# AI Wound Analysis System

An AI-powered application that enables users to upload videos or images of wounds for analysis. The system uses advanced artificial intelligence to assess wound healing progress and provide personalized advice to patients.

## Description

This project facilitates wound monitoring by analyzing user-submitted wound images or videos. The AI model evaluates whether the wound is healing properly and delivers actionable guidance to support patient care. It also securely stores analysis results, allowing users and healthcare providers to track overall healing progress over time.
